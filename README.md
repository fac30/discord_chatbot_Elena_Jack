# DISCORD **AI CHATBOT** ðŸ¤– - by Jack and Elena

## Overview
This project aims to create a Discord bot using Node.js that integrates with the Discord API and OpenAI for dynamic responses.

## Checklist

- **Project Setup with Libraries**
  - [x] Create a new Node.js project.
  - [x] Install `discord.js` and `openai` libraries using npm.
  - [x] Set up `discord.js` and `openai` by requiring them in your project.
  
- **Secure Configuration**
  - [x] Create a `.env` file to store API keys.
  - [x] Use `require('dotenv/config')` to load API keys from the `.env` file.
  - [x] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive information is not committed to the repository.

- **Bot Initialization**
  - [x] Initialize the Discord bot with `new Discord.Client()`.
  - [x] Log in to Discord using `client.login` with your Discord token.

- **Message Handling**
  - [x] Set up a message event listener with `client.on('messageCreate', callback)`.
  - [x] Process incoming messages and respond with a "hello" message.

- **Optimization**
  - [ ] Implement efficient event handling.

- **OpenAI Chat Integration and Response Generation**
  - [ ] Integrate OpenAI into the bot.
  - [ ] Use `openai.chat.completions.create()` with your API key to generate responses.
  - [ ] Pass conversation history and other necessary parameters to receive context-aware chat completions.

- **Response Management**
  - [ ] Manage OpenAI responses returned by `openai.chat.completions.create()`.
  - [ ] Send the response back to the Discord channel.

- **Command Processing**
  - [ ] Process commands directed at the bot using string matching or a command prefix.
  - [ ] Distinguish between general messages and commands meant for the bot.

- **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Implement error handling using `.catch` or `try...catch` within `fetch` or `async` functions.
  - [ ] Manage exceptions and provide error messages if something goes wrong.

## Stretch Goals

- **Messaging Users Directly**
  - [ ] Utilize the `user.send()` method in Discord.js to send direct messages to users.

- **Dialogue Boxes and Interactive Responses**
  - [ ] Implement Discord's message components like buttons and select menus using `MessageActionRow` and `MessageButton` or `MessageSelectMenu` classes from Discord.js.
  - [ ] Handle interactions with `client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, callback)`.

- **Creating Private Chats (Channels)**
  - [ ] Use `guild.channels.create()` to create new private channels and manage access using permission overwrites in Discord.js.

- **Automated Moderation Features**
  - [ ] Monitor messages for specific keywords or patterns using `client.on(Events.MessageCreate, callback)`.
  - [ ] Implement moderation actions like `message.delete()` for removing inappropriate content and `guildMember.timeout()` for muting users.

- **Multimedia Responses (Images, GIFs, Audio Clips)**
  - [ ] Send multimedia content using `message.channel.send()` with the `files` option.
  - [ ] Explore Discord.js voice modules for handling voice channels and streaming.

# Extra Notes

## View a branch when reviewing a pull request
- to view a remote branch from someone else you must
    - git fetch -p
        - this will get the meta data for new repos and *prune* the old deleted remote repos
    - check to that branch
        - you should checking the github repo and seeing what pull requests there are in relation to what branch you want to be checking
        - if you need help finding the branch use:  git branch -a
        - **** if the list of branches are getting to long and hard to find the right one use: git fetch -p, then try again with git branch -a
    - If you approve of the pull request changes, accept the pull request on github to merge to main
        - remember to delete the branch on github
## Post pull request
- after accepting pull request you must
    - update your main on local
        - check to main
        - pull
    - merge main to your local working branch (local meaning your vscode)
        - check to your working branch
        - merge main
    - **there will be a merge conflict**, resolve the merge conflict in vscode with the conflict editor (there is a button)
        - if we want everything, accept both, otherwise use judgement of what which one needs to be implemented
    - you may need to git commit after merge to conclude it
    - after merge, remember to push your local working branch to github
        - git push
This will allow to work on your current feature but ensure it's uptodate with main
## When you have done some code you want to add to main
- make sure you have added, committed and pushed everything in vscode
- on github make a pull request for your branch
